Cricket Insights is a project aimed at analyzing real-world cricket player data using SQL and Power BI. The project focuses on gathering data about cricket players from various formats such as Tests, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20s (T20s), and visualizing their performance statistics including batting, bowling, and fielding.

**Objectives:**
1. **Build Database:** Utilize Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to construct a robust database structure that organizes player profiles alongside their attributes such as country, date of birth (DOB), batting style, and bowling style. Establish relational integrity to ensure coherence and consistency in the data model.
   
2. **Performance Analysis:** Examine player performance by assessing factors such as batting, bowling, and fielding. Utilize Power BI to transform numerical data into easily understandable visuals, enabling the presentation of insights such as bowling and batting performances of players from different countries, as well as year-wise statistics of individual players across various types of matches.

**Repository Contents:**
- SQL scripts for creating database tables and inserting data (`Create_Player Table.sql`, `Insert_Player Data.sql`, etc.).
- Power BI template file for visualization (`Cricket Insights.pbit`).
- README.md providing an overview of the project objectives, description, and instructions.
