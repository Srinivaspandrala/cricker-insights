Cricket is a beloved sport with players who have made lasting impacts on the game. Understanding player performance through data analysis is crucial for both teams and fans. The goal is to create a project using SQL and Power BI to analyze real-world cricket player data, focusing on player stats like batting, bowling, and fielding.

This project will gather data about cricket players from various formats such as Tests, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20s (T20s). Using SQL to create a database that stores player information, match data, and performance stats. Then, utilize Power BI to visualize this data in easy-to-understand charts and graphs.

The gathered information about cricket players will include their country, date of birth (DOB), batting style, and bowling style. This data will provide insights into players' backgrounds and playing preferences across different formats.

To enhance the "Build Database" objective, include references between tables for relational integrity. Utilize Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to construct a robust database structure. This database will organize player profiles alongside their respective attributes, such as country, date of birth (DOB), batting style, and bowling style. Establish relational integrity by incorporating table references where necessary, ensuring coherence and consistency in the data model. Additionally, ensure compatibility with Power BI by structuring the database in a way that facilitates seamless integration with the visualization tool. This will enable easy extraction and analysis of data from SQL Server in Power BI, allowing for the creation of insightful visualizations and reports to communicate the findings effectively.

For performance analysis, closely examine how players perform by assessing factors such as batting, bowling, and fielding. This helps identify players' strengths and areas for improvement. Utilize Power BI to transform numerical data into easily understandable visuals. This approach enables the presentation of insights such as bowling and batting performances of players from different countries, as well as year-wise statistics of individual players and their performance across various types of matches.
